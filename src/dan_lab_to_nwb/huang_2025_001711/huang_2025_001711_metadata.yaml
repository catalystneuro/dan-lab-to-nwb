        name: Camera1
        description: The B0205 is a new member of Arducam's USB camera family. Based on 1/2.7” OV2710, it's a 2MP, UVC-compliant, wide-angle USB 2.0 camera with a motorized IR-Cut filter and infrared LEDs. The motorized (switchable) IR-CUT filter and infrared LEDs can be triggered by the photoresistor according to the light environment to be ON/OFF to block or pass the infrared light. It can be widely used in wildlife photography, home security systems, baby cameras, etc.

  ElectricalSeriesEEG:
    name: ElectricalSeriesEEG
    description: EEG voltage data was recorded by a TDT acquisition system. A second backup channel was recorded in case the signal in the first channel is compromised. During data extraction, the redundant channel was discarded to conserve space.
    filtering: The data was band-pass filtered between 0.5 Hz and 750 Hz using second-order filters. Notch filters were applied at 60 Hz, 120 Hz, 180 Hz, and 240 Hz with 20 dB attenuation and 1/10th octave bandwidth to remove power line interference and its harmonics.
