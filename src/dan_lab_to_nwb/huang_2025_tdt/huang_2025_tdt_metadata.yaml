      description: The Splitter Branching Fiber-optic Patch Cord evenly splits the light from a large core diameter connectorized optical fiber into 2 or more branches of smaller core diameter connectorized optical fibers. A 15 cm long large core optical fiber helps obtain uniform distribution of light before a launch into 2 or more optical fibers bundled inside the central tubing. A 2-branch Splitter Branching Fiber-optic Patch Cord typically outputs around 16 % of the input power.
